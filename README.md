# GeoFS Friends List ‚Äì Tampermonkey Script
A handy script/addon to add friends and see who is online in GeoFS (Geography Flight Simulator). 

## Description
This Tampermonkey script adds a friends list to GeoFS , so you can always know which pilots (by their callsigns) are currently online. You can manually add friends, and the script will track whether they're active in the game.

The script shows:

‚úÖ Online friends (with aircraft name)
‚ùå Offline friends
üü¢/‚ö´ Status icon next to the player count indicating if any friends are online
All data is stored locally using localStorage.

## Installation
Install a userscript manager such as:
Tampermonkey
Greasemonkey
Go to the script page or download the .user.js file.
Click "New Script" in your manager and paste the contents of the script.
Open GeoFS and click the friends icon next to the player counter to open the list.

## Features
Add friends by their callsign
Remove friends from your list
Automatically see who is online
Color indication (green/black) for online/offline status

Marking them on map

## UI Location
After installation, a friends icon will appear next to the player count in GeoFS. Click it to open the friend list panel.

## Data Storage
All friends are stored in localStorage. This means:
